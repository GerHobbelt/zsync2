zsync 0.6.4
===========

zsync is a file transfer program. It allows you to download a file from a
remote web server, where you have a copy of an older version of the file on
your computer already. zsync downloads only the new parts of the file. It uses
the same algorithm as rsync.

See the [main README](c/README) for more details.
