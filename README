quicksync 0.6.4
===============

quicksync is a file transfer program. It allows you to download a file from a
remote web server, where you have a copy of an older version of the file on
your computer already. quicksync downloads only the new parts of the file. It
uses the same algorithm as rsync.

quicksync is a fork of zsync, to be used with [quickemu](https://github.com/wimpysworld/quickemu), and adds
an option to allow to output of the progress bar even if not started from a tty.
This is usefull for GUI developpers.

NOTE : the documentation is from the original repo, and still refers to the binary
as `zsync`. Replace with `quicksync` accordingly. The `makequicksync` binary is not built
by this fork.

quicksync does not require any special server software or a shell account on the
remote system (rsync, in comparison, requires that you have an rsh or ssh
account, or that the remote system runs rsyncd). Instead, it uses a control
file - a .quicksync file - that describes the file to be downloaded and enables
quicksync to work out which blocks it needs. This file can be created by the admin
of the web server hosting the download, and placed alongside the file to
download - it is generated once, then any downloaders with quicksync can use it.
Alternatively, anyone can download the file, make a .quicksync and provide it to
other users (this is what I am doing for the moment).

Installation
------------

See the file INSTALL for instructions on compiling and (optionally) installing
quicksync.

As quicksync is still at a very early stage, you may prefer not to install it, and
to run the program where you compile it. It will work fine that way - it has no
data files or libraries. The man(1) program on some systems will let you read
the man pages without installing them, e.g. man -l doc/quicksync.1 .

quicksync is free software. There is no implied support, no implied fitness for
purpose, no warranty. You use it at your own risk.

Use
---

In its simplest form, as an end-user:

quicksync http://some.example.com/downloads/my-big-download.tar.quicksync

Someone has to make a .quicksync file for the download before you can use quicksync. As
quicksync has not been around long, there won't be many such downloads around :-).
And you have to have an older copy of the file around, otherwise there is
little point in using quicksync - quicksync normally looks in the current directory for
a file of the same name as the one being downloaded (note: if the download is a
.gz file, the local file should be uncompressed - use gzip -d to decompress it
first). If the local file is not in the current directory or has a different
name, you can specify it with -i, e.g.:

quicksync -i /var/lib/apt/lists/ftp.uk.debian.org_debian_dists_sarge_main_binary-i386_Packages http://quicksync.moria.org.uk/s/sarge/Packages.quicksync

Offering quicksync downloads
------------------------

Simple example:
Suppose you have http://example.com/dl/some-image-0.2.iso ; which is in
/var/www/downloads/ on your server.

cd /var/www/downloads/
quicksyncmake -u 'http://example.com/dl/some-image-0.2.iso' some-image-0.2.iso

This creates some-image-0.2.iso.quicksync in the same directory, and specifies the
URL from which users can retrieve the full file. (Note that quicksync requires both
the public URL for the full download, and a local copy of the same file. Users
will still need access to the full downloads - quicksync merely allows then to save
time by only downloading parts of the file.)

A user with v0.1 of the same file can now use quicksync to download only the new
bits.

quicksync -i some-image-0.1.iso http://example.com/dl/some-image-0.2.iso.quicksync

Compressed example:
Support you have http://example.com/downloads/big-0.2.tar.gz ; which is
in /var/www/downloads/ on your server.

cd /var/www/downloads/
quicksyncmake -u 'http://example.com/downloads/big-0.2.tar.gz' big-0.2.tar.gz

This creates big-0.2.tar.quicksync in the same directory, and specifies the URL
from which users can see the file.  

A user with v0.1 of the same file can now use quicksync to download only the new
bits:

quicksync -i <(zcat big-0.1.tar.gz) http://example.com/downloads/big-0.2.tar.quicksync

-----------------------------------

quicksync is based on the rsync algorithm, by Andrew Tridgell. It also incorporates
a number of optimisations, based on ideas in academic papers by Utku Irmak,
Svilen Mihaylov and Torsten Suel (primarily "Improved Single-Round Protocols
for Remote File Synchronization", Sept 2004).

quicksync uses a large part of zlib - this code, in the zlib subdirectory, is
copyright 1995-2003 Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler, see zlib/README for
details. This code contains local changes by me that are not compatible with
and not available in standard zlib; see zlib/README.quicksync for an explanation.

quicksync includes an implementation of getaddrinfo by Motoyuki Kasahara. See
getaddrinfo.c for the license, it's a BSD-style license; but normally quicksync
compiles against the getaddrinfo() in the system libc, so this code is not
normally used.

quicksync also includes checksum code taken from OpenBSD. The MD4 code is public
domain, by Colin Plumb and Todd C. Miller. The SHA1 code is also public
domain, by Steve Reid. This code is in the libhash/ subdirectory, see the
individual files for their non-copyright notices.

The rest of the code (that is, everything not in the zlib and libhash
subdirectories) is
Copyright (C) 2004,2005,2007,2009 Colin Phipps <cph@moria.org.uk>.

COPYING for details.

Thanks also to:

* Dennis Schridde, for contributing patches to improve portability.
* Timothy Lee, for finding bugs and supplying patches.
* Richard Kiss, for supplying a patch for MacOS X compilation.

I must thank the developers above, whose code I have used. Also, I would like
to thank the Free Software Foundation and its contributors, for gcc, gdb and
emacs, the essential development tools. Also I would thank Sourceforge for
providing the hosting facilities for the downloads and mailing list, and the
compile farm for testing portability.
